allocation command including specific commands. For example, a shard can
be moved from one node to another explicitly, an allocation can be
canceled, or an unassigned shard can be explicitly allocated on a
specific node.</p><p>Here is a short example of how a simple reroute API call:</p><div xmlns="" class="pre_wrapper"><pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="programlisting prettyprint lang-js">POST /_cluster/reroute
{
    "commands" : [
        {
            "move" : {
                "index" : "test", "shard" : 0,
                "from_node" : "node1", "to_node" : "node2"
            }
        },
        {
          "allocate_replica" : {
                "index" : "test", "shard" : 1,
                "node" : "node3"
          }
        }
    ]
}</pre></div><div xmlns="" class="console_widget" data-snippet=":CONSOLE:"></div><p>An important aspect to remember is the fact that once when an allocation
occurs, the cluster will aim at re-balancing its state back to an even
state. For example, if the allocation includes moving a shard from
<code class="literal">node1</code> to <code class="literal">node2</code>, in an <code class="literal">even</code> state, then another shard will be moved
from <code class="literal">node2</code> to <code class="literal">node1</code> to even things out.</p><p>The cluster can be set to disable allocations, which means that only the
explicitly allocations will be performed. Obviously, only once all
commands has been applied, the cluster will aim to be re-balance its
state.</p><p>Another option is to run the commands in <code class="literal">dry_run</code> (as a URI flag, or in
the request body). This will cause the commands to apply to the current
cluster state, and return the resulting cluster after the commands (and
re-balancing) has been applied.</p><p>If the <code class="literal">explain</code> parameter is specified, a detailed explanation of why the
commands could or could not be executed is returned.</p><p>The commands supported are:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
<code class="literal">move</code>
</span></dt><dd>
    Move a started shard from one node to another node. Accepts
    <code class="literal">index</code> and <code class="literal">shard</code> for index name and shard number, <code class="literal">from_node</code> for the
    node to move the shard <code class="literal">from</code>, and <code class="literal">to_node</code> for the node to move the
    shard to.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<code class="literal">cancel</code>
</span></dt><dd>
    Cancel allocation of a shard (or recovery). Accepts <code class="literal">index</code>
    and <code class="literal">shard</code> for index name and shard number, and <code class="literal">node</code> for the node to
    cancel the shard allocation on. It also accepts <code class="literal">allow_primary</code> flag to
    explicitly specify that it is allowed to cancel allocation for a primary
    shard.  This can be used to force resynchronization of existing replicas
    from the primary shard by cancelling them and allowing them to be
    reinitialized through the standard reallocation process.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<code class="literal">allocate_replica</code>
</span></dt><dd>
    Allocate an unassigned replica shard to a node. Accepts the
    <code class="literal">index</code> and <code class="literal">shard</code> for index name and shard number, and <code class="literal">node</code> to
    allocate the shard to. Takes <a class="link" href="modules-cluster.html" title="Cluster">allocation deciders</a> into account.
</dd></dl></div><p>Two more commands are available that allow the allocation of a primary shard
to a node. These commands should however be used with extreme care, as primary
shard allocation is usually fully automatically handled by Elasticsearch.
Reasons why a primary shard cannot be automatically allocated include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
A new index was created but there is no node which satisfies the allocation deciders.
</li><li class="listitem">
An up-to-date shard copy of the data cannot be found on the current data nodes in
the cluster. To prevent data loss, the system does not automatically promote a stale
shard copy to primary.
</li></ul></div><p>As a manual override, two commands to forcefully allocate primary shards
are available:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
<code class="literal">allocate_stale_primary</code>
</span></dt><dd>
    Allocate a primary shard to a node that holds a stale copy. Accepts the
    <code class="literal">index</code> and <code class="literal">shard</code> for index name and shard number, and <code class="literal">node</code> to
    allocate the shard to. Using this command may lead to data loss
    for the provided shard id. If a node which has the good copy of the
    data rejoins the cluster later on, that data will be overwritten with
    the data of the stale copy that was forcefully allocated with this
    command. To ensure that these implications are well-understood,
    this command requires the special field <code class="literal">accept_data_loss</code> to be
    explicitly set to <code class="literal">true</code> for it to work.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<code class="literal">allocate_empty_primary</code>
</span></dt><dd>
    Allocate an empty primary shard to a node. Accepts the
    <code class="literal">index</code> and <code class="literal">shard</code> for index name and shard number, and <code class="literal">node</code> to
    allocate the shard to. Using this command leads to a complete loss
    of all data that was indexed into this shard, if it was previously
    started. If a node which has a copy of the
    data rejoins the cluster later on, that data will be deleted!
    To ensure that these implications are well-understood,
    this command requires the special field <code class="literal">accept_data_loss</code> to be
    explicitly set to <code class="literal">true</code> for it to work.
